# Using match-lstm and SQuAD dataset to test how different settings of adversarial training affect model robustness
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The model implementation of this project is a work by xingdi-eric-yuan. We have built our code on top of his MatchLSTM implementation.
For the original MatchLSTM project, check out https://github.com/xingdi-eric-yuan/MatchLSTM-PyTorch

This is a work in progress. The readme will be changed later.
